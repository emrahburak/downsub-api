00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.240
in a sport known for pushing the body to its&nbsp;
absolute limit one event stands Above the Rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.320
a race where no amount of talent or training&nbsp;
can spare you from the crushing pain at the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.000
finish a blend of technique speed and endurance&nbsp;
that's run right on the razor's edge of physiology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.040
and grit but he's run himself into a gold medal&nbsp;
and the hospital by the looks of it but uh welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:37.200
to the Beauty and the brutality of the 400 m 400 m&nbsp;
is just a single lap around the track not exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.120
an intimidating distance how could it possibly&nbsp;
be the most difficult defendant track and field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.000
surely there are more formidable challenges&nbsp;
found in the middle to longer distances right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.200
you know the ones that require massive aerobic&nbsp;
capacity extended Focus race tactics but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.920
see the thing with those longer races is they&nbsp;
allow room for pacing moments to recover even a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.760
stride or two taken less imp perfectly you might&nbsp;
even have time to Hype up the [Music] crowd then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.080
there are the shorter Sprints although they&nbsp;
require technical Precision massive amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.920
of power and leave pretty much no room for error&nbsp;
they're simply over too quickly these subject the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.760
athlete to a momentary blast not a prolonged&nbsp;
struggle enter the 400 m technically it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.840
long Sprint and practically it's a theater&nbsp;
of pain even at the highest level [Music]

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.680
he also hinted that his coach is trying to&nbsp;
persuade him to try the 400 m I'm hoping not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.840
um I'm trying to discourage my coach from&nbsp;
that but I'm one of those persons I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.040
really back from anything unless you're&nbsp;
giving me a 400 and I don't want to run

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.080
it so in any event longer than the 400 the start's&nbsp;
pretty unremarkable with a quick Shuffle to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.120
line a brief pause and off they go the start&nbsp;
of the 400 is vastly more challenging that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.920
because it involves one of the most technical&nbsp;
elements in the sport the block start now in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.960
the 400 you can't win the race at the start but&nbsp;
you can certainly lose it so what makes block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.640
start so difficult well first a good block start&nbsp;
requires precise Technique we find over hundreds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.520
if not thousands of hours you got the body angles&nbsp;
the timing of force application the path of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.200
back foot the distance of the first step the&nbsp;
list goes on then there's the sheer physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.800
demand from a dead standstill athletes have&nbsp;
to launch their body forward creating immense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.760
linear force and of course then you got the&nbsp;
mental component the split-second reaction to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:53.620
the starters pistol and then that ever looming&nbsp;
threat of a false start false start L [Applause]

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.680
four it's a race that begins with&nbsp;
immediate pressure then things get

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.960
complicated so the Crux of the race comes down&nbsp;
to one of the few indisputable facts in track&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.480
and field which is no person on the planet&nbsp;
can run the 400 all out from start to finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.560
the reason why it comes down to how the body&nbsp;
creates energy and the way it does so during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.760
the 400 is the most painful so here's an easy way&nbsp;
to think about it you have three Energy Systems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.960
to Power movement they work on a Continuum&nbsp;
and there are individual differences but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.840
no matter what when intensity is high energy&nbsp;
comes at a price so during the first 50 m of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.320
the race the body uses immediate energy stored&nbsp;
as ATP and foser creatin think of this as your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.760
body's version of a short sharp rocket booster&nbsp;
so this energy is rapid and intense but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.840
very shortlived it's usually expanded within&nbsp;
the first 6 to 10 seconds so at the start of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.680
the race athletes unleash it pushing from&nbsp;
90 to 100% of their Max right from the gun

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:12.040
[Music] after that initial burst Runners&nbsp;
transition into a phase that sustains a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.240
high but not maximum speed so now we're on&nbsp;
to the second energy source called anerobic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.240
glycolysis as this fuel's created we've got&nbsp;
lactate and the associated hydrogen ions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.320
which to simplify we're just going to refer&nbsp;
to as lactic acid this byproduct causes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.120
muscles to burn and impairs function if this a&nbsp;
shorter Sprint like the 100 or 200 this isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.960
a concern the race is over well before lactic&nbsp;
acid becomes a factor this is where strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.200
in the 400 is Paramount if you go too fast&nbsp;
too soon you're going to accumulate lactic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.840
acid well beyond what the body can handle you&nbsp;
can't ease off that much either so you got to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.480
maintain a near Peak Pace without tapping&nbsp;
out your reserves cuz at the end of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.680
phase you're only halfway [Music] there this&nbsp;
is where the third Energy System comes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.520
play it's a shift from quick but limited energy&nbsp;
production to a more efficient process that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.320
support prolonged endurance but again there's&nbsp;
a catch aerobic energy isn't created nearly as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.800
fast which means there's a looming energy crisis&nbsp;
on the horizon energy demand will soon outstrip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.240
Supply setting the stage for an intense showdown&nbsp;
of physiological limits in the Final Phase of the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:29.520
race this is what it all comes down to the fourth&nbsp;
stage is where chaos prevails especially if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.160
you didn't get the other phases right but&nbsp;
even if you did get the other phases right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.062
the final stretch is still hell on Earth just&nbsp;
ask anyone who's run the race as this reditor

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:38.080
[Music] [Applause]

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:54.080
did at this point the body is on the brink&nbsp;
of exhausting its Anor robic energy reserves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.120
the body attempts to fill the energy gaps&nbsp;
with more aerobic energy but because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.400
a slower process it's struggles to match the&nbsp;
immediate and intense demands of the Sprint and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.160
the rising acidity within the muscles not only&nbsp;
induces agonizing pain but it's also starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.000
to impair muscular function this is where the&nbsp;
true mental battle begins to unfold not one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.400
of tactics but one of guts the final stretch&nbsp;
is not just a race against competitors it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.680
duel between an athlete's drive to succeed and&nbsp;
the overwhelming desire to ease the pain this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.200
Crucible this intense showdown of heart and&nbsp;
mind is what defines the essence at the 400

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:40.340
[Music]

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:50.480
